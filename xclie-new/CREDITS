Redesigned the whole to add a new `backend` mode.

`as_backend` mode runs php code in another thread,
but uses the xclie_event functions to allow php code
and C / C ++ to communicate with each other.

currently it implemented `string` mode.
but, it should support `binary` mode also.

the `event` APIs are:

1. xclie_event_issue(event_type, event_data)
2. xclie_event_issue(event_data)

	issue an event to php/native side with type and data string.
	if fail, returns zero (false in php), succeed, return one (true in php)

	--

	int32_t xclie_event_issue(const char* type, const char* data).

	--

	* Either type or data must not be an empty string.

3. xclie_event_wait(timeout)
3. xclie_event_wait()

	Waits for an event for the specified timeout (ms).
	If 0 is specified, it returns without waiting. If -1 is specified,
	infinite wait is performed.

	And, this function cannot wait above the PHP_INT_MAX (INT32_MAX) value.
	Except for infinite waiting.

	--

	int32_t xclie_event_wait(xclie_event* out_event, int32_t timeout)

	--
		
	return value:
		array ( type => event-type, data => event-data )

	NOTE: `Key` is set only if an empty string is not specified.
